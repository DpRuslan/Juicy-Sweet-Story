The program is a puzzle game. For this project I used CoreData to save levels(show locked unlocked levels) and best time of game.
Also, used delegates, unique design, navigation through different controllers, Auto Layout, attributed strings, custom font, etc.
The main goal of it is to make puzzles( do different manipulations on UI and save, update changes in CoreData).
